# Java Testing Project: Employee & AdvancedMath

## ðŸ“– About

This project is designed to demonstrate effective Java testing strategies using JUnit 5. It includes two primary classes, `Employee` and `AdvancedMath`, along with corresponding unit test files.

### ðŸ”‘ Features

1. **Employee Class**
   - Models an employee with attributes like name, job title, and salary.
   - Includes input validation for constructors and methods.
   - Methods tested:
     - `introduce()`: Introduces the employee.
     - `giveRaise(double percentage)`: Updates the employee's salary by a percentage, with validation for negative input.

2. **AdvancedMath Class**
   - Provides basic mathematical operations with input validation and exception handling.
   - Methods tested:
     - `addition(int a, int b)` and `addition(String a, int b)`: Overloaded methods to add integers or a string-represented number to an integer.
     - `multiply(int a, int b)`: Throws a custom `OverTheLimitException` if the result exceeds integer maximum value.

3. **JUnit 5 Tests**
     - Ensure proper exception messages.
     - Test edge cases such as invalid input formats and large values.
